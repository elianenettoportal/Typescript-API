# Project TypeScript

TypeScript is a strongly typed, object-oriented, compiled programming language that builds on JavaScript.
It is a superset of the JavaScript language, designed to give you better tooling at any scale.

Typescript is a compiled language. The compiler TCS(Transcript compiler script) will transcript the code to javascript to be able to run in NodeJS or Web Browser
The TypeScript compiler is written in TypeScript.<br>
As a result, it can be compiled into regular JavaScript and can then be executed in any JavaScript engine (e.g. a browser).<br>
The compiler package comes bundled with a script host that can execute the compiler.
